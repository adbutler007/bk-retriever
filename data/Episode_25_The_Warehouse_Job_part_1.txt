In this game session, the players continue their investigation into Bertrand's home, discovering a variety of items with their names on them, including a painting, newspapers, and marionettes. They decide to remove these items from the scene to avoid suspicion from the police, particularly Cadbury, who they encounter outside the house. They warn Cadbury about the severe mold problem in the house and advise him to keep it under guard.

While leaving the house, Eldren notices a loose floorboard. Upon investigation, he finds a fiddle, a bow, and a letter underneath. The letter, presumably written by Bertrand, speaks of his fear and excitement about something he created for Ramsey and the stranger. It also mentions a leviathan and dark stars, hinting at the influence of the star fragment. The letter is dated three weeks before the premiere of the opera.

The players decide to return to their hotel due to their weakened state from the mold poisoning. Before going to bed, they discuss the strange occurrences and the items they found. They are particularly puzzled by the transcription of their conversation up until they entered the house. The next morning, they identify the fiddle as the "Second Fiddle," which is likely meant for Bo, the bard in the party. The players then mark off a long rest, recovering from their poisoning.
The group starts their day by having breakfast with their commanding officer, Valiant, at their usual spot. Valiant appears to be in high spirits after her meeting with Shona, a dangerous yet intriguing woman. She hints at a potential secret job offer from Shona, which could be high-paying but would need to be kept confidential. The group discusses the implications of taking on such a job, considering it could potentially harm their reputation if they continue to accept secret assignments.

The group also discusses their findings from Bertram's house, which leaves Valiant shocked and concerned. She suggests comparing the handwriting on the various documents they've found to determine if Bertram and the other figures are the same person or different individuals.

During their conversation, Casimir, the leader of the Spices Guild, joins them. He appears exhausted and frustrated, having not slept for two days while dealing with the aftermath of the theater incident. He informs the group that the hole in the theater's orchestra pit is still present and causing problems. The theater is unusable as long as the hole remains, weakening Muscovar's cultural standing among the Broken Kingdoms. Casimir also mentions a time warp effect that occurs when the doors to Nebula Hall are closed, causing time to pass differently inside and outside the hall.

Trigger has a revelation, recalling a dream where he jumped into a similar hole, which then closed. He realizes that if he jumps into the hole in the theater, it would close, but he would die. The group discusses this revelation, weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks. They consider the possibility of using the time warp effect to their advantage, potentially turning the theater into a highly productive space. However, they also express concerns about potential dangers that could emerge from the hole.

The group contemplates buying the theater and using it as their headquarters. However, they acknowledge the cultural significance of the theater and doubt that it would be sold. The session ends with the group still undecided on their next course of action.
The characters are in a hotel discussing their recent experiences with time dilation in the theater. They contemplate the implications of this phenomenon, including the possibility of using it to their advantage for training or other tasks. They also discuss the potential risks, such as forgetting to lock the door or someone opening a window. 

They are joined by Knuckles and Hawthorne, who report on their scouting activities. Nugget, a halfling spy, shares two spy reports: one on Baku and one on Muscovar. Baku is described as a fortress with secret police-level security, while Muscovar is revealed to have staked at least 23 players in the recent casino tournament. The group theorizes that this could have been a money transfer operation, but they are unsure who the intended recipient might have been. 

The group decides to send Hawthorne back out to scout the city and surrounding territory. Nugget and other secondary characters are tasked with finding a permanent headquarters in the city and investigating the casino situation further. 

Meanwhile, Trigger and Gift plan to use the time dilation in the theater to calculate where a spell fragment fell. However, their initial calculations are unsuccessful. The group also jokes about using the time dilation for intense physical training, referencing the hyperbolic time chamber from Dragon Ball Z. 

The rest of their company is camped outside the city, with the scout corps patrolling the surrounding territory. The group is aware that their presence in the city is known, but they have not made a grand show of their arrival.
The players discuss their next steps after receiving a lot of new information. They have three options: go to the warehouse, go to Kurz's house, or take an out-of-town job. They decide to go to the warehouse first, which is located in Quayside, the trade district near the docks. The warehouse is actually a series of three buildings, each guarded by two pirates. The guards are dressed in leathers and carry homemade weapons. The buildings are all one story, but the warehouses have lofted ceilings. The players plan their approach, considering the potential for choke points and the possibility of people inside the buildings.
The group of adventurers, Rock, Eldren, Bo, Specter, and Trigger, are tasked with reclaiming a warehouse from a group of brigands. They decide to approach the situation with a mix of stealth and confrontation. 

Rock and Eldren approach the front gate, while Specter and Trigger plan to take out a sentry on the roof. Before they engage, they interact with a group of street kids who provide information about the brigands, revealing there are about 20 of them led by a man named Captain Whiskers. The kids also hint at some undisclosed information they're withholding for their own protection.

Rock confronts the guards at the front gate, offering them a chance to surrender. When they refuse, he uses a spell called Sword Burst, dealing significant damage and killing both guards. However, in his attempt to kick open the gate, he sprains his ankle, leaving him with a limp.

Meanwhile, Specter and Trigger prepare to take out the sentry on the roof. Trigger plans to use a minor illusion to distract the sentry, allowing Specter to sneak up on him. The session ends before they can execute their plan.
In this session of the role-playing game, the characters are attempting to infiltrate a guarded area. The character Rock tries to kick open a gate but fails, alerting the guards to their presence. Bo then simply opens the gate and turns invisible, while Eldren summons eight velociraptors to distract the guards. 

Meanwhile, Specter and Trigger are on a rooftop, observing the situation. Specter successfully assassinates a scout on the roof, and Trigger uses a teleportation ability to join him. From their vantage point, they see the velociraptors attacking the guards. 

Trigger then uses magic missiles to attack one of the guards, while Rock kicks open another door, revealing more enemies. Rock strategically retreats after alerting the team to the new threats. 

The guards, armed with shark-toothed swords, manage to kill one of the velociraptors. A priest-like figure attempts to cast a spell on Eldren, but Eldren successfully resists. 

Specter then attacks an archer from the rooftop, alerting more enemies to their presence. Bo, still invisible, moves through the enemies and casts a silence spell on the priest-like figure, preventing him from casting spells. The session ends with the characters in the midst of a large-scale battle.
In this session of the role-playing game, the characters engaged in a combat scenario. One character alerted the group that enemies were on the roof, then took cover in a horse stall and shot at Elgin, the only visible character. However, he changed his target to a Velociraptor, dealing three points of damage. 

Another character, represented by a loot token, moved forward and used a thunder attack on two Velociraptors, killing one and damaging the other. The Velociraptors then took their turn, attacking various enemies. One Raptor killed an enemy, while others inflicted damage on different foes, including the bard. 

Elgin, who was in dragon form, was attacked by an enemy with a hook, causing him to be grappled and take six points of piercing damage. He was also asked to make a constitution saving throw, which he passed due to his dragon form. 

Eldren, another character, attacked the priest with a guiding bolt, dealing 15 points of radiant damage. He then moved to hide behind some barrels. 

The session ended at the end of the first round of combat, with the group deciding to continue the game in the next session due to the complexity and length of the ongoing battle.
